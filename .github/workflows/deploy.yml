# name of the workflow that appears in the git actions tab
name: Deploy to Github Pages

# This defines WHEN the workflow should run
on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # Triggers automatically when you push the code to the 'main' branch

  workflow_dispatch: # This allows you to manually trigger the deployment from github action tab
  #Useful when you want to redeploy without making a new commit

# Permissions needed for the workflow to interact with Github pages
permissions:
  contents: read # Allows the workflow to read your repository code
  pages: write # Allow the workflow to delpoy to github pages
  id-token: write # Needed for secure authentication with GitHub Pages

# A workflow contains one or more "jobs" that run in parallel or sequece
jobs:
  # This is our single job named "build-and-deploy"
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # The job runs on an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine (GitHub provides this for free)

    # Steps are the individual tasks that run sequentially in this job
    steps:
      # 1. Download your repo code to the virtual machine
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # This is a pre-built action from GitHub that clones your repo

      # 2. Install Node.js on the VM
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4 # Pre-built action to install Node.js
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Specifies which version of Node.js to install (change if needed)
          cache: 'npm' # Caches npm dependencies to speed up future builds
        # This means dependencies won't be re-downloaded if package.json hasn't changed
      
      # 3. Install all project dependencies from package.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'npm ci' is faster and more reliable than 'npm install' for CI/CD
      # It uses package-lock.json to ensure exact versions are installed
      # Use 'npm install' if you don't have a package-lock.json file

      # 4. Build the project
      - name: Build webpack application
        run: npm run build # Executes the "build" script from your package.json
      # This runs webpack and creates production-ready files in your dist folder

      # 5. Package the built files for GitHub pakages
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2 # Pre-built action to prepare files for deployment
        with:
          path: './build' # Tells the action where your built files are located

      # 6. deploy the packaged files to Github Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment # Gives this step an ID so other steps can reference it if needed
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v3 # Pre-built action that actually publishes to GitHub Pages
    # This takes the artifact from the previous step and makes it live on the internet
